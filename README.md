# PyBer Analysis

### Overview of the Analysis
Purpose: To aggregate and analyze PyBer ride sharing data by city type and to create data visualizations to present to the CEO and decision makers to help provide key insights.

### Results

Urban city centers encompassed the overwhelming majority of total rides, total drivers, and total fares; accounting for more than the rest of the city types combined. Conversely, average fares per ride and average fares per driver were highest in the Rural Areas and lowest in the Urban Areas. Rural areas also had the highest ratio of total rides to drivers. The lower supply of drivers along with the likely increased travel distance in rural areas most likely leads to an increase in the average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

### Summary
Based upon the results, I would recommend allocating more drivers to the Suburban and Rural because the higher average fare per ride will bring in more revenue and drivers will be willing to go for the higher fares. Of course, wait time between fares can be an issue, and it is hard to tell which times are busiest in these areas based on the current dataframe. I recommend having us resample the dataframe by time of day and city type to see which times are likely going to bring in the most revenue and start there. After that, I would focus on the Urban areas and try to figure out why so many drivers are needed and what can be done to cut costs to increase profit.
